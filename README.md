# Sharedbike-mobilitypatterns-hotspotscoldspots
We aim to explore urban spatial activity patterns in Xiamen Island using shared bicycle data. Analyzing GPS trajectories and user features, we identify hotspots, temporal variations, and distinct usage patterns in different areas. The findings offer valuable insights for urban planning and transportation, with implications for other cities as well.
